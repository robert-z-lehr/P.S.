P.S. is a reference tool that leverages Generative AI to act as a personalized mentor, assisting students in thoroughly mastering a domain of knowledge. Currently in development and pilot testing, it is being used to teach applied probability and statistics to engineers and scientists.

Complementing this tool is A.N.N.A., the Analogous Neural Network Advisor, which connects to the OpenAI API to produce curated analogies, metaphors, similes, parables, and aphorisms. Understanding complex content often requires relatable examples, and these figures of speech provide countless clear explanations related to the material being taught.
